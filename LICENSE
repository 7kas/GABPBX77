GABpbx is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
with Sangoma US Inc. If you obtained GABpbx under the GPL, then the GPL
applies to all loadable GABpbx modules used on your system as well,
except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
source tree in the file COPYING.

This package also includes various components that are not part of
GABpbx itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
GPL version 2 as well.

Sangoma US Inc. holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the GABpbx package, and therefore can grant, at its
sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or
organizations to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL)
modules which may be dynamically linked at runtime with the portions
of GABpbx which fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or are
distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for GABpbx we
would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).

Specific permission is also granted to link GABpbx with OpenSSL, OpenH323
UniMRCP, and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.

In addition, GABpbx implements several management/control protocols.
This includes the GABpbx Manager Interface (AMI), the GABpbx Gateway
Interface (AGI), and the GABpbx REST Interface (ARI). It is our belief
that applications using these protocols to manage or control an GABpbx
instance do not have to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license,
as we believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work' as referred
to in the GPL. However, should any court or other judiciary body find that
these protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a
license to use these protocols in combination with GABpbx in external
applications licensed under any license you wish.

The 'GABpbx' name and logos are trademarks owned by Sangoma US Inc,
and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
redistribution of GABpbx source code obtained from Sangoma, you
should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
steps you must take. For more information on this policy, please read:
