# lame quickie script to snarf a core of a hung gabpbx process.
# bugs to ast_grab_core, blinky-lights.org  (derrick daugherty)

# we have found that gcore doesn't yield as useful a core file
# as that yielded by a signal-caused core dump. So we are going to change
# the strategy to sending a SEGV signal to the gabpbx process,
# and have it 'burn to the ground', leaving behind a core file.
# the main difference is that you cannot control where the
# core file will end up. We will assume that safe_gabpbx was
# used to start gabpbx, and the core file should therefore end
# up in /tmp (because safe_gabpbx cd's there before starting gabpbx).
# if this is not the case, set DUMPDIR to the place where the core
# file can be found.

DATE=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`
DUMPDIR=/tmp
HOSTNAME=`hostname`
ADMINEMAIL="root@localhost"

#the following should be improved

elif [ -e /var/run/gabpbx.pid ] ; then 
	PID=`cat /var/run/gabpbx.pid`

	echo Could not find an gabpbx.conf definition for astrundir,  using \'ps\'
	echo to try and determine process ID.  This is not reliable.
