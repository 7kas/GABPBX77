.SH NAME
.B safe_gabpbx
\(em A wrapper to run the gabpbx executable in a loop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B safe_gabpbx
.I [ gabpbx_params ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B safe_gabpbx
is a script that runs gabpbx in a loop, which can be useful if you
fear gabpbx may crash.

The script does not run in the background like a standard service. Rather,
it runs in its own linux virtual console (9, by default).
It also uses the option '\-c' of gabpbx(8) to avoid detaching gabpbx
from that terminal.

safe_gabpbx also runs gabpbx with unlimited core file size, and thus
gabpbx will dump core in case of a crash.

To get a "picture" of console 9, from another terminal (e.g: from a
remote shell session) you can use:

  screendump 9

The init script of the Debian package should be able to run safe_gabpbx
as the gabpbx service, if so configured. See comments in
/etc/default/gabpbx

.SH FILES
.B /tmp
.RS
safe_gabpbx runs in that directory, rather than in / as usual.
.RE

.B /tmp/core
.RS
If core files were generated there, they may be
.RE

.B /etc/gabpbx/startup.d
.RS
Files in this directory will be 'source'd by the safe_gabpbx script before
it starts GABpbx proper, allowing them to set additional environment variables
or run any other steps that are needed for your system.
.RE

.SH BUGS
While showing the output on a console is useful, using screen(1) as
the terminal may be better.

The script does not read configuration from standard location under /etc

It uses fixed locations under /tmp , and thus may be exposed to a
symlink attacks.
